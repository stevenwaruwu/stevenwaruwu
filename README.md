### 📝 About Me

I'm an experienced IT Infrastructure Consultant and entrepreneur with a strong track record across banking, hospitality, and fisheries sectors. I specialize in designing secure, scalable systems and have built a legally recognized agritech company that supports national aquaculture programs and global exports.

My work spans from managing hundreds of servers and virtual machines to developing cloud-based backup systems, cross-border logistics, and real-time monitoring platforms. I bring a builder's mentality, strategic planning skills, and a passion for mentoring rural communities.
